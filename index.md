	<summary><h5>Part Six</h5></summary>
	<p>The bryde whale with the timer on its back is not leaving the harbor. It swims a wide ellipse all afternoon, its gray back glinting in the sun. Ivy, George, and L stay out in the boat for more than an hour, listening to the sloshing of the water against the boat and waiting for the whale to breach again, which it does every twenty minutes or so, slowly drawing itself up out of the water, high enough that when it comes back down it sends a swell their way that makes the boat rock. It's as if the whale is showing off the timer, which L comes to realize looks like a giant 1980s-era Timex watch.</p>
		<p>By the time they return to the beach, a crowd of about twenty people has gathered. As George, Ivy, and L walk onto shore, the crowd remains silent, tight with anticipation.</p>
		<p>Finally, Tess, a biologist, speaks. "Was that a fucking whale? I saw it breach near you." She is a nearly six-foot tall, wiry southeast-Asian woman with bright eyes, a shaved head, and a scratchy voice. Back in regular life, her job was trekking through jungles looking for some of the most poisonous snakes in the world, then harvesting their venom for research </p>
		<p>George shrugs. "We were observing the crates when it showed up with that timer on its back." </p>
		<p>"Timer? Is that what it is?" a middle-aged Australian woman says. "We can't read it from here."</p>
		<p>"That’s what it looks like,” Ivy says. “When it showed up, it read 7:23:55.” She turns her notebook around, shows the group a drawing she did of the whale. "Next time we saw it, about twenty minutes later, it said 7:04:51." She shows them another drawing. "I think it's counting down." </p>
		<p>"Fuck," says Tess. "So we have about eight days left to fix this place." The entire group jerks their heads toward her. She sighs. "Look, I've been here since the beginning. I know some of you have other theories, but I think we’re meant to clean up those dirty waters. I think it’s some kind of test, that’s what I think." She looks down as she talks, almost shy, but with a strong, unwavering voice. "We're all from 2019, right? 2019, a year in which the world is at risk of skidding into a runaway greenhouse effect. We're dipping our toes into the waters of the apocalypse. Well, this island is very nice and all, but out there—" she points—"out where the water goes dark, it's also apocalyptic." She pauses now, looks around, and finds the group rapt. "It's radioactive, dirty as fuck, and even hotter than it is here. I think we've been brought here because we're meant to learn how to save our planet. This is like a practice round. Like one of those hackathon competitions or something. Maybe, if we learn how to save this island, we'll understand how to save our planet too." </p>
		<p>A murmur runs through the crowd now.</p>
		<p>“So someone forced us to come here, just as a test?” scoffs a gray-haired tall American, who L remembers was a high school science teacher. </p>
		<p>“So someone forced us to come here, just as a test?” scoffs a gray-haired tall American, who L remembers is a high school science teacher. </p>
		<p>"We haven't been lazy!" someone yells.</p>
		<p>"Ok," the farmer continues. "But we've been focusing on settling in, making ourselves comfortable. Surviving. Now we've been given a clear message. We have less than eight days to do what we've come here to do." </p>
		<p>Some people groan and roll their eyes. Ivy and L share a glance. <em>Could be right</em>, Ivy seems to be communicating. </p>
		<p>"Look, this whale could mean <em>anything</em>," says George. "We need to consider all possibilities. But I seriously doubt it's a message from some higher power."</p>
		<p>"Not a higher power. It's a message from the Director," someone says. </p>
		<p>"The Director?" L asks.</p>
		<p>George sighs. "The Director is what some people have been calling the guy who—"</p>
		<p>"Or the woman," says Ivy</p>
		<p>"Or the woman," George says, nodding, "who, if Tess’s theory is correct, would’ve brought us here."</p>
		<p>"Could be a group of people too," says Tess.</p>
		<p>"Yes, but the point is we don't <em>know</em> anything about them," George says. "We shouldn't just be wildly guessing here, there's no point."</p>
		<p>"But you're missing an important truth. That type of scientific skepticism makes sense back in the normal world, but it doesn't work here," says Pai, an older Thai woman, an artist. "Everything in this world has a reason. It is <em>curated</em> for us. From the supplies we were just miraculously given, to the perfectly temperate microclimate of this island, to this amazing weather we’ve been having."</p>
		<p>"So, let's say you’re right," says L now. "We’re meant to fix the apocalyptic zone out there, clean up the water. What does that change? What can we actually do? What steps do we take first?”</p>
		<p>The group falls silent.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, Brendan, the silent hut builder, steps forward and waves his arms. Once he has the others' attention, he begins gesturing, pointing almost frantically, toward the water.</p>
		<p>"What? Are you talking about the whale?" </p>
		<p>He shakes his head, and then kneels down and begins writing something in the sand. "We need to retrieve the cr–" but as he writes a wave comes farther up the beach and begins to erase his work.<p>
		<p>"I didn't see," some people shout.</p>
		<p>He begins miming a box shape.</p>
		<p>"He's saying we need to retrieve the crates. He's saying that's what we should focus on," says George. Brendan nods. "I agree," George says. "Look, it’s hard for me to believe in this Director character—I’m more of the camp that this is some sort of biological accident, that we all stepped through some wormhole or other—"</p>
		<p>“It makes no sense!” says Pai.</p>
		<p>“Ok,” says George. “But my point is that if you guys are right that we're being prompted toward certain activities, then yeah, it seems clear to me at least that we need to somehow retrieve those fuckin' things."</p>
		<p>There's a moment of silence and George looks around at the group, sighing, a little out of breath from nerves, his eyebrows knit. L feels herself sweating. The afternoon sun is pointed directly at them now.</p>
		<p>"Impossible," someone says. "They're radioactive."</p>
		<p>"Yep," George says. "And we were beamed through space and time onto this fucking island."</p><p>It's as if the group has suddenly pointed themselves in the same direction, aligned with one another spiritually, and L can feel the energy shift into something powerful—the potential energy of a group of twenty or more people committed to a singular goal.</p>
		<p>And then the building momentum breaks. "Fuck that," says a young Chinese physicist. “I’m figuring out a way home.”  </p>
		<p>The argument on the beach lasts until nightfall, until the hermit crabs begin taking over and the group decides to head back to the main house to prepare dinner. By the end of the day, it's decided that from this point on, the group would focus more on trying to explore Apocalypta, as they began to call the water beyond the fluorescent green, zig-zag border. And, while a contingent of them would work on retrieving the crates, the other, more spiritually minded contingent, would work on searching for signs from the Director.</p>

	<summary><h5>PART FIVE</h5></summary>
		<p>It feels right to be out on the water again. Back in her old life, L spent nearly every morning on a long-tail boat going out to a dive site. That half-hour ritual had always allowed her to collect her thoughts, the noise of the gas engine drowning out everything but the waves, the wind, and the sun. A morning boat ride meant she was on her way to do something worthwhile.</p>
		<p>But there is no sound of an engine here. Only the creak of a metal boat, and oars slapping the water. And instead of soaring along, Ivy and George are slowly rowing them toward the astonishing border, which shines fluorescent green against the bright blue sky.</p>
		<p>Their progress is strained, because as they approach the threshold, the current resists them. George's hairy back begins sweating profusely, but Ivy has covered up well, in a hat and baggy white shirt.</p> 
		<p>When L shields her eyes, she can see a tiny wave, maybe 15 centimeters high, zig-zagging along the border. She tries to think of scientific reasons for this--underground columns perhaps, but nothing, nothing about it seems natural.</p> 
		<p>They stop rowing. By now, she can see what those shapes are that she'd noticed from the shore. Islands of plastic crates, painted a neon gold that glints in the sun. Behemoths, guarding whatever lies beyond.</p>
		<p>"What's in all these crates?"</p>
		<p>"We haven't been able to figure that out," says George. He digs in his bag and removes a handheld device with a screen on it. He swipes his thumb across it to turn it on and, after a moment, a reading of ".3" shows up. "It's not safe to go check them out."</p> 
		<p>"What's that?" L asks.</p>
		<p>"A geiger counter," says Ivy. "You have to take one when you come out here."</p>
		<p>"Is .3 safe?" L asks.</p> 
		<p>".3 sieverts isn't great, but for a short period of time, we're fine," says George.</p> 				<p>"What about closer to the border? Does it change?"</p>
		<p>"Oh yeah," says Ivy. "It gets much worse. Actually, George had wanted to take another reading of the levels closer to the border. But we don't have to if you're not comfortable."</p> 
		<p>"Well, if you guys are sure it's safe enough. I mean do you know for sure how dangerous it is? I don't mean to be rude, but..." How reckless are we being here?</p>
		<p>"Well, yeah, I do," says George. "I'm a nuclear engineer."</p>
		<p>"Oh, well that's pretty fuckin' handy," says L.</p> 
		<p>"Yeah, pretty much everyone who arrives here has some kind of highly relevant skill," says George. His tone is nonchalant, but his expression communicates otherwise. It says, yeah, isn't that fuckin' creepy?</p> 
		<p>"So," says L.</p> 
		<p>"So, the last time we rowed up to the border, it was at 5 sieverts per hour. That's pretty damn high. If we stayed at that level for an entire hour, at least one of us would die within a couple weeks."</p>
		<p>"Woah," says L.</p>
		<p>"But, when we take a reading, we just row up to it quickly, stay there for maybe 5 seconds before rowing back--the levels fall really quickly down to a safe level. So we end up getting a dose of like .007. That's like...4 CT scans?"</p>
		<p>"Ya know what? I think I'll go for a swim," says L. "Let you guys do your thing."</p> 
		<p>"Totally cool," says George.</p> 
		<p>L hops out of the boat and swims a bit toward the shore. George and Ivy give each other a look and then row three times, moving several meters forward before bobbing back a half-meter. L sees Ivy record the reading in a small notebook and then they quickly row back toward her.</p>
		<p>"What'd it say?"</p>
		<p>"4.9," says Ivy. "About the same as last time."</p> 
		<p>L pulls herself back into the boat. "So now what?"</p>
		<p>"Typically," George says, "We row to a safe area and then we just chill. It seems pretty obvious that we need to go check out those crates, but there's no way to get out there. So we've somehow got to bring them--"</p>				<p>"To us," says L.</p> 
		<p>"Exactly," says George.</p> 
		<p>"Won't they be radioactive?"</p>
		<p>"We'll see. The radiation could fall back down past the border zone, we don't actually know. That black water could be totally safe."</p>
		<p>"It doesn't look like the safest water," L says. As a SCUBA diver, the opaqueness of the water beyond the threshold horrifies her at a deep level.</p> 
		<p>"No," says George. "But, even if the crates are radioactive, there's ways to clean things to make them safer to handle."</p> 
		<p>"Gotcha. So now, we just think?"</p>
		<p>George turns up his hands. "Nothing better to do really."</p>
		<p>They row back to an even lower radiation level and Ivy gets out her drawing supplies. The sun is really out now. L wishes she'd brought more cover. In her haste, she didn't even bring a hat and is just wearing her bathing suit top and shorts. "You try a magnet?" she asks.</p> 
		<p>"We'd need a pretty fucking powerful magnet," says George.</p> 
		<p>She has no other ideas. "Well, what have you tried?"</p>
		<p>"Uh, nothing?" says George. "We've mainly been setting things up, trying to survive. Ivy and I only recently started trying to come out here regularly.</p> 
		<p>They sit in silence. After awhile, Ivy has drawn a striking image of the border, capturing with her colored pencils the near exact shade, and fluorescent nature of its glowing green. Finally she puts the sketchbook down. "I guess we should head back soon," she says.</p>
		<p>"Wait," says George. "Just give me a few more minutes." L notices that his brow has furrowed and his whole body has become still. He stares at a single spot in the direction of one of the crates.</p> 
		<p>L follows his gaze. After a minute, she sees something. Or did she? A ripple in the calm black water. So small she doesn't say anything. But then, a minute later, the three of them gasp. Back beyond one of the gold crates, something emerges out of the water and then dips back down under it. A whale, or a shark, the hint of its shiny grey back standing out in stark contrast against the onyx of the water. But there was something strange about it, something on its back.</p> 
		<p>When it appears again, it's much closer. L sees now that it has a band around its torso, a wide, black rubber band, and attached to the band is something, something with a screen and flashing red figures. "It's a bryde whale," says L, noting the tall, falcate dorsal fin, and now, as it resurfaces again, the three characteristic head ridges. Again, a whale endemic to the Gulf of Thailand, one she would have no trouble identifying, even though she's seen them only a handful of times.</p> 
		<p>The three of them are frozen as the whale approaches. The next time it emerges, it breaches, straining up out of the water, higher than it seems it should be able to go before it slams its gigantic body back down, creating a huge splash, the edges of which reach their boat and provide a cool relief to L's burning forehead. Her breath is shallow. On the screen were numbers--what were they?</p> 
		<p>Now the whale resurfaces and skims the surface only 10 meters away. They can see clearly its message now: a clock, counting down: 07:23:55.</p>
</details>

	<summary><h5>PART FOUR</h5></summary>
		<p>After her conversation with Ivy, L walks down to the beach and digs a shallow hole. She lies down in it and imagines she’s her old family dog. She sniffs at the salty air and tries to slow her heartbeat. As the sun begins to set, she falls asleep.</p>
		<p>She wakes to a touch on her shoulder. It’s George, standing over her, bathed in the waning green light coming from the horizon. Next to him is a squat, bearded man with an inscrutable expression.</p>
		<p>“Sorry!” George says. “We just thought you should probably get set up for the night! This is Brendan, our resident tent-builder.” The other man sticks out his hand and L shakes it. “Brendan doesn’t talk,” George says. “He used to be able to before he arrived, apparently.”</p> 
		<p>Brendan nods once to confirm.</p>  
		<p>“Want to go pick out your home base?” George asks.</p>  
		<p>L nods, though the word "home" makes her want to run into the ocean and start swimming.</p> 
		<p>They meander through the jungle until L chooses a spot. It’s about five minutes up the path on the side of the house, next to what can hardly be called a creek: a thin stream of water running over some rocky dirt at the bottom of a manmade ditch.</p>  
		<p>L watches and occasionally assists while Brendan builds her a temporary tent, using tarps and bamboo poles. He communicates to her via gestures that she will have a hut like the others within a week. After a while, L points to his mouth and turns up her hands. He shrugs, then opens his mouth wide and pushes in his diaphragm. The noise that comes out is barely a moan, riding high on top of a wind of breath.</p> 
		<p>"So, you can't even make noise really?"</p> 
		<p>Brendan nods.</p>  
		<p>By nightfall, they have made a teepee with a lower skirt as well as a top skirt, which can be removed to allow for airflow on nights when it isn’t raining. It’s hard to say whether exposing herself to the island’s mosquitoes is worth the breeze. That night, she falls asleep as soon as she lies prostate on her loaned sleeping bag. In the morning, she finds herself scratching a sore into her thigh. She is covered in bites. Throughout the day, the others chuckle at her thick welts and constant scratching. They tell her she will get used to it. Besides, they say, no one has gotten any mosquito-borne illness so far, so she doesn’t need to worry.</p>  
		<p>Over the first few days, L keeps her distance from the others. Since they don’t push her to join in on their activities, she gathers that she is probably behaving pretty normally for having recently teleported. Meals are served communally and L gets in the habit of taking an aluminum plate out to the beach to sit alone. To avoid the others who work at the beach lab, she walks a kilometer or so to a bamboo dock, to which a small metal boat is tied.</p> 
		<p>She spends entire afternoons studying the line where the radioactivity begins. The water close to their island is clear, but several kilometers away, near the land on the other side of the bay, the color changes. After a flourescent green threshold, the water looks black. In it, she can see vague shapes bobbing up and down.</p> 
		<p>In the evenings, the tide moves out, revealing a biodiverse, shallow, littoral zone for a dozen meters out. L puts on a pair of too-big water shoes available in the main house and goes exploring. She is careful to step only on rock and dead coral because the living reef here seems healthy and she doesn’t want to damage it. Crabs, sea cucumbers, and urchins abound. The pistol shrimp, which are mostly too small to see, make their presence known by a loud popping sound. She imagines they are protesting her and the others’ presence here, unnatural as it is, by shooting tiny guns. There is also a species of snake or worm that she doesn’t recognize, which darts out from under one rock to go hide under another. She chases it one evening for almost an hour, trying to catch it, but it’s too quick.</p> 
		<p>Besides idle observation, L sleeps. The fatigue that had come over her in the week before her teleportation seems to have only gotten worse. She estimates that she’s spending at least 12 hours a day in a deep sleep. To avoid the mosquito bites at night, she keeps her tent closed and often wakes up in a pool of sweat. It’s hot and humid here. Although she might have time-traveled or changed dimensions, it doesn’t appear that she’s left Thailand.</p>  
		<p>When the tide comes in, or when she wades out a little farther, she can see countless fish just by looking down into the water. All the regular culprits are there: butterfly fish, rabbit fish, damsels, groupers. These fish feel familial, as if they are the very same ones she spends hours looking at every day back home. Altogether, this biosphere is remarkably consistent with that of her home island, despite its being surrounded by filth and decay.</p>  
		<p>Especially at night, the beach is populated by a bevy of hermit crabs. When she doesn’t want to think anymore, she races two of them against each other, digging out mazes on the beach and taking bets against herself for which crab will win.</p>   
		<p>The thought often enters L’s mind that she has gone crazy. Each day, she asks one or another of the group to confirm for her the story as she understands it. They use different words, but convey much the same message. Everyone arrived suddenly without any clear directive, but with all the supplies they need to perform their vocations, even if it meant scrounging around the island a bit. She estimates there are around thirty residents in all. The mood among the group feels uncannily happy. As if, despite the existential horror, they are enjoying themselves. She wonders if she will feel this way after a while.</p> 
		<p>Toward the end of her first week, she is eating her breakfast by the dock when George and Ivy approach. George throws a bag of equipment into the boat.</p> 
		<p>“What are you guys doing?” L asks.</p>  
		<p>“We’re going out there,” says Ivy, pointing toward the bay on the other side. She holds a notebook and a pencil case.</p>  
		<p>“Isn’t it dangerous?” L asks.</p>  
		<p>“No one’s gotten rad poisoning yet,” says George with a shrug.</p> 
		<p>“It’s not dangerous as long as we don’t go over the radioactive threshold,” Ivy explains. “Would you like to join?”</p> 
</details>

<details>
	<summary><h5>PART THREE</h5></summary>
		<p>Just inside the forest is what appears to be a small village. All around her, wedged in between tall coconut and palm trees, are simple bamboo huts on platforms. There must be thirty or so, each of a similar size and design: a window on the left and a bamboo door. Inside the open huts L sees an odd assortment of camping pads, sheets, quilts, and knitted blankets.</p> 
		<p>Deeper into the forest, there is a large, two-story house made of adobe bricks. A gate closes off the first story, creating a crawl space and flood zone underneath the main area of the house. On the second story, there is a large porch, where electronics and various supplies are laid out. The place is porous, open-doored, an inside-outside place. It looks like it could be overtaken by the jungle at any moment.</p>
		<p>As they approach someone shouts from inside, “Ahhh!!” Alarmed, L looks at her new host, eyes wide.</p>
		<p>“That’s okay,” he says. “That’s just Ivy. She probably saw a snake.” He’s smiling again.</p>
		<p><em>This guy is cheery.</em></p>
		<p>She continues to follow him up the dirt path toward the house, looking out for snakes and other critters. On her island she’d grown used to keeping an eye out for certain pests: red centipedes whose sting is so potent you need morphine to deal with the pain, two-meter long cobras, sand flies whose bites took weeks to stop itching. But who knows what the dangers are here. She figures she can’t be too far from home, but something tells her she can’t be so sure.</p>
		<p><em>My sense of direction is off. The iron in my nose is de-magnetized, as my dad used to say. Ha.</em></p> 
		<p>On the porch are several bamboo woven maps, upon which are arrayed a variety of tools; arduinos, wires, and batteries, as well as natural tools like coconut husks, banana leaf wrappers, and small structures made from bent sticks.</p>
		<p>Inside the house several other scruffy humans stretched out on bamboo mats. Some of them are writing or drawing on paper, others arrange wires on small circuit boards.</p>
		<p>“This is everybody,” he says, gesturing. “You’ll meet them all in a moment.”</p>
		<p><em>Why do I need to meet all these people? Can’t you take me back home?</em></p>
		<p>They all look up at her with the same genre of expression: empathetic despair.</p>
		<p>She doesn’t feel despair, or rather didn’t. But now it creeps in, a worm that multiplies and divides again and again, until it has clogged up her brain, rendering her physiology sluggish.</p>
		<p>George catches this in her eyes.“Let’s talk for a bit,” he says and motions to two lawn chairs in the corner beside a small table. They are within earshot of the rest of the group and it makes L uncomfortable. The word <em>cult</em> flashes again in her mind and she remembers the story of a woman two years back, found in the jungle on her home island. Barely twenty years old, trying to escape from a yoga cult, she thought she could take a shortcut through the jungle. A couple weeks later she was found dead, half-eaten by lizards. </p>
		<p>“I know this is weird,” George says, and L notices for the first time that his voice is soothing, or rather that it has all the qualities of being soothing, while at the same time giving off an artificial effect. “When I first got here it felt like a dream, or maybe even a nightmare. I kept feeling like I would wake up soon and go back home. But…well…I’ll explain that part later. First thing you should know is that you’re safe and the people here are safe. These are good people. Generally they’re artists, scientists, engineers. Would you say you fit into one of those categories?”</p>
		<p>“Biologist,” she murmured.</p>
		<p>“Ah, a biologist. Interesting. The last four have been biologists, perhaps there’s a new species we’re meant to discover,” he said to her, but well within earshot of the others, who turned and raised their eyebrows in interest.</p>
		<p>“What?” she says, out loud now. “What are you talking about?”</p> 
		<p>“I’m sorry, I know this is overwhelming at first</p>
		<p>“Look, all I need is a phone!” she says firmly.</p>
		<p>“We don’t have one here,” he says. </p>
		<p>She’s getting ready to give up, walk back down to the beach and figure this out on her own. Get away from these weirdos. “Look,” she says. “I just got in a little bit of trouble SCUBA diving and need some help getting home. Are you going to help me get back home? Are you? If I’m being totally upfront with you, if I’m being totally fuckin’ straight, I don’t really know where I am or how I got here. I was SCUBA diving. I was under the FUCKING WATER AND NOW I’M HERE.” She’s got her hands on the arms of her chair now, more weight flowing into them bit by bit.</p>
		<p>The room is staring at her now, but they seem unconcerned. George looks at her with understanding.</p>
		<p>“I’m sorry,” he says. “We’re still figuring out how to welcome people. I know I was totally confused when I got here. You see, this is not a normal island. You’ve…well… teleported here. Or time traveled or something. We all did.”</p>
		<p>She gets up, her knees slightly bending, her hands almost in fight stance. As she walks toward the door, the creak of her bare footsteps on the wooden floor fill the room. The others gaze up at her with the same sorry empathy they had for her before.</p>
		<p>On the porch, the sun hits her hard and she begins running toward the beach.</p>
		<p><em>What the fuck what the fuck what the fuck.</em></p>
		<p>She plops herself down under a palm tree and puts her hands on her temples. Her headache is coming back.</p>
		<p>After a few minutes a woman approaches her and sits down nearby. At first, L avoids her gaze.</p>
		<p>“Um, if you want I can try to explain things,” she says after a moment.</p>
		<p>L looks at her. This woman doesn’t have the wide-eyed look of the others. She's a thin Asian woman with round hipster glasses and an oversized cotton button-up shirt. For the first time, L realizes that most people here are dressed in ill-fitting clothes.</p>
		<p>“So, uh, ok here we go. Well first of all, we don’t know what this place is exactly.”</p>
		<p>"Very helpful," L says.</p>
		<p>“But what we do know is that people started showing up here two months ago and we get a new person every couple of days. People show up on the beach in various states of undress, without any possessions. Last week, I was in the middle of taking off for a flight to Singapore, and then I found myself washed up on that beach, trying to breath through a nose full of sand. Another few people were SCUBA diving, just like you, when they showed up.”</p>
		<p>She trails off, as if trying to prioritize all the information she has to convey.</p>
		<p>“Also, we can’t really go anywhere else. We’ve built a raft to explore the surrounding sea, but we can only go so far. It's generally calm, but past a certain point it's full of jellyfish and trash. And there is some land across the bay, but it appears to be radioactive. This little island is like a Garden of Eden or something. Unlike everything else, it’s not radioactive and apparently, according to George and some of the others who got here first, there were all these supplies there, even when the first ones arrived. There is fresh water, and plenty of food to be foraged. The little kitchen off the main house was there, stocked with some basics. You can see we’re starting some gardens near the house,” she says, pointing toward rows of dark, humus-laden, bare earth, near the front porch of the house.</p> 
		<p>L wants to believe it’s a joke, or a dream, or something, but there is emotion behind what this woman says. If it’s all a trick, she’s buying in despite herself, at least for now.</p>
		<p>“What the hell?” L says.</p>
		<p>The woman widens her eyes and tightens her mouth, as if to say, yeah, pretty fucked up right? “I’m Ivy, by the way,” she says and shakes L’s hand.</p>
		<p>“So what, were we brought here by some evil scientist or something?” L says, laughing.</p>
		<p>“That’s our best guess right now,” Ivy says, to L’s shock. “But again, we don't know. Most of the others are scientists, and there were tools left for making all sorts of robots and shit. Perhaps someone wanted to see what we could do with this world we seem to be stranded in.”</p>
		<p>“What do you do then?” L asks.</p>
		<p>“I’m a cartoonist,” Ivy says with a shrug.</p>

		<p>She sits up and digs her hands into the cool sand. She’s right at the shore line and the water laps at her like a salt-seeking dog. She examines her limbs and finds no wounds, no bruises, no scraped skin. Her skull, too, appears unharmed. She is intact. Despite this, she feels weak and somewhat disoriented. Not knowing what else to do, she lies back and waits for understanding to return to her. </p>
		<p><em>Probably this is a remote beach near where we were diving. And…my team just thought I needed medical attention and that I shouldn’t be moved. Probably they’ll be back soon.</em></p>
		<p>As the shock of being alive and in an entirely different place from her last recollection fades, she begins to re-inhabit her body and finds that the sensations are mostly bothersome. Sand in her shorts and a terribly parched throat. It’s the first time she notices that not only does she lack SCUBA gear, but her wetsuit is gone too—she's sporting only her shorts and bathing suit top.</p>
		<p>A noise from inside the forest 500 meters down the beach sends a jolt of fear down her limbs. Moments later, a figure emerges. From far away, he looks like an early human: hairy, bearded, broad-chested, a bit of a lumbering walk. He wears khaki shorts with patches on them. She’s reminded of the tanned Russians she used to see camped out in abandoned tin mines on a secluded beach near one of the regular dive sights. They’d emerge late mornings, make fires, do laundry, and lay out in the sun as if ready to die, toasting evermore their already tan bodies. This guy has their look, but not their cool, relaxed posture. He walks exuberantly, then begins to jog toward her.</p>
		<p>**</p>
		<p>“Welcome!” he yells, cupping his hands around his mouth.</p>
		<p>She starts to get up but feels light-headed again.</p>
		<p>“Don’t get up!” he shouts, holding out his hands.</p>
		<p>She sits back down, surprising herself with her subservience. Half-wondering if she should get up and run, she stays put. </p>
		<p><em>My body must still be in shock.</em></p>
		<p>Now the man is close. She sees that he is young, perhaps late-twenties or early-thirties, with an excited expression on his face. Nothing like those blasé Russians from the tin mines. He smells of sweat and soil. He kneels down beside her and extends his hand.</p>
		<p>“Welcome. I’m George!” he says and she takes his hand and squeezes. A moment passes wherein she could give her name. “I don’t normally do this!” he says. “I’m not the one to welcome people, I mean. This is exciting!”</p>
		<p>Sensing he needs to project more seriousness, he lowers his voice. “You seem to have retained your strength. Your muscles feeling okay otherwise? No aches or spasms?”</p>
		<p>She shakes her head.</p>
		<p>“That’s good, sometimes people come here with some decompression sickness,” he explains.</p>
		<p>They stare at each other for a moment, both unsure of how to bridge the chasm of ignorance between them.</p>
		<p>“I was foraging in the forest there and heard someone groaning a bit,” he explains. She doesn’t remember making any sounds. “Maybe that was when you were waking up?” he adds, intuiting her confusion.</p>
		<p>“I think I got in some kind of accident. I don’t fully understand,” she says finally, laughing a bit, awkwardly. “I’m just sort of trying to sit here and center myself,” she says, thinking maybe she could get this guy to leave her alone for a bit longer, give her a little more time to remember what the hell happened. Because whatever is happening it’d probably be best to figure out on her own. <em>Right?</em> You never knew what kind of Westerners you’d encounter in this part of the world. There wasn’t a small chance she’d landed on an island run by a yoga cult. Heck, there could be a guy just around the corner with ‘magic powers.’</p>
		<p>“Sure,” he says. “What were you doing before you found yourself here?”</p>
		<p>“Well, I was SCUBA diving. Or I thought I was. But I don’t have any of my gear with me. I think my team is probably nearby.”</p>
		<p>He nods. “Once you feel okay to walk we should go back to the main house and we can tell you everything we know. Want to try to walk a bit?” he asks and puts out his hand.</p>
		<p>“Wait, what do you mean everything you know?” she says laughing. “If I could just use a phone, I’ll call my office, someone should be there.”</p>
		<p>He makes a sympathetic noise with his mouth that she can’t quite interpret. “Why don’t we come back to the house first thing? You see—you’ve landed on a pretty peculiar little island here. I’ll explain everything back at the house. We’ve got great people there that can take care of you. So please, it’s just a five minute walk into the forest. Let me show you.”</p>
		<p><em>Definitely a cult. Oh well, maybe they’ll have a phone at least.</em></p>
		<p>She hoists herself up, declining his proffered hand. They begin walking toward the forest. She expects to hobble a bit, to stumble maybe, but instead she feels lithe.</p>

	<summary><h5>PART ONE</h5></summary>
		<p>Lately, every time L ascends, she feels on the verge of passing out. About two meters from the surface, she finds herself needing to grasp onto the inflater nozzle of her BCD in order to remind her body of the task at hand. The water squeezes her, the churning, womb-like sounds surrounding her and disorienting her. The sun, filtered by the water into individual rays, hits like a spotlight, causing her to shield her eyes even as she felt herself hungrily drawing toward it.</p>	
		<p>And now, once again, she finds herself on the surface, back in her right mind, back on solid ground, which is in fact the choppy surface of the water. The sun steady, the physics standard. Escaped. Just a weird sensation was all.</p>
		<p> Ever since she was a beginner diver, she’d felt a whiff of this sensation, but in the past few weeks it’s become stronger every dive. Glancing around to check that the interns she's been diving with are well, she actually wonders—if she were to let herself go on autopilot during ascension, allow her mind wander even just a bit, would she make it? Or would she pass out, sink to the bottom, die immediately? </p>
		<p><em>What an unscientific thought</em>. Likely she was becoming dizzy as a result of a slight physiological malfunction. An inner ear issue. Or maybe it was simply that this feeling mimicked that of not wanting to wake up from a good dream—it was so peaceful under there after all, so cozy, meditative. Your mind couldn’t be scattered. The water directed your focus, plied your attention toward what it wanted to show you.</p>
		<p>“My god, I know how you feel,” her colleague, E, tells her as they unsuit back on the boat. E grunts as her tank clinks into its holder. “Sometimes I just don’t want to leave that world.” </p>
		<p>“Maybe that’s all it is,” L replies, but still she can’t explain why the sensation is getting stronger, or—could she say—worse?</p>
		<p>**</p>
		<p>Two hours later she is entering the day’s data into the Thai governmental database. On that morning's dive, she and her team of interns completed a fish survey and noted this bounty: forty-five butterfly fish, nine bream, five parrot fish, three angel fish, twenty-five wrasse, forty-five cardinal fish, and one soap fish. Still much fewer snapper than she’d like to be seeing, but the other fishes were doing well.</p>
		<p>E types away beside her, probably messaging with a prospective intern: an eager undergraduate or beleaguered graduate student, looking for a suitable research site to host them as well as an exciting Southeast Asian experience. A storm has rolled in. L’s nostrils are alerted to a metallic smell as large raindrops begin to fire away on the roof like they mean to put a hole in it. She feels as if the space has become smaller, as if the world would be happy to do them in.</p>
		<p>L leans her forehead on her hand, rubs her temples. “I’ve got a bit of a headache now,” she says. E turns toward her and frowns.</p> 
		<p>“Take a paracetemol,” E says and, sighing, turns back to her computer. Then she groans. “This student wants to bring his girlfriend. But she’s not going to do any research. She just wants to hang out.” She rolls her eyes.</p>
		<p>L gets up and heads to the kitchen to get a drink of water. On her fourth step, a curtain comes over her vision and all she can see is black. “I’m going blind,” she says as she collapses to the floor.</p>
		<p>When she wakes up, E is standing over her. Her face looks old, and the geometry of it evokes an ancient math. L is sure, then, that there have been hundreds of people throughout human history that looked exactly like E.</p>
		<p>And then she feels her heart beating faster than it should be beating. Her breath is deep and rapid at the same time, as if she can’t get enough air. But she respires, her heart beats, and she can see.</p> 
		<p>“I’m okay,” she says.</p>
		<p>“My god, what is wrong with you?” E yells, her Russian accent really coming out now. “Do you want me to call an ambulance?”</p>
		<p>“No, no,” L says. “I just stood up too fast I think. Something a little off with my circulation lately, maybe my blood pressure.”</p>
		<p><em> Maybe I’m fucking pregnant. Fucking pregnant, that’s a funny phrase.</em></p>
		<p>“My god, go home,” E says. “Take the day off.”</p>
		<p>“But new students are coming, I have to orient them.”</p> 
		<p>“Honey, you need to take some time <em>off</em>.”</p> 
		<p>**</p>
		<p>A couple hours later L is in her house, in her bed, inside the mosquito net. Her headache has faded and she feels fine. The storm has passed away, leaving behind thin, shifting, planes of air. She’s reading a dense, poetic book about water and how to interpret it. She’s enjoying the language, but can’t process much meaning from it. She puts the book down and looks at her nightstand. Two pregnancy tests rest there, staring up at her with two blank eyes. No results.</p>
		<p><em>How is this possible?</em></p>
		<p>Pregnancy was unlikely, as she and her various partners on the island always used condoms, but you never knew. So she could understand a positive result and she could understand a negative result but a non-result was perplexing to say the least.</p> 
		<p><em>Just a little low on iron from my last period. Something, something like that.</em></p>
		<p>It is barely five o clock. A breeze blows in and a rodent scampers across her roof. The cicadas are quieting down to a low, tired, scratching, only needing to cool themselves down a little in this breezy landscape.</p> 
		<p><blockquote>“We will look at water as the subject. Mammals and insects are interesting, but they will only earn their place in this book to the extent that they can explain the behavior, the signs and symbols of water.” </blockquote><p>
		<p>She puts the book down and falls asleep. She sleeps 12 hours. At 5 am a gecko lands on the wall of her bungalow just outside her head and calls out, loud and clear, “unh unh, unh unh, unh unh,” and she jolts awake, thinking the gecko is in her bed, that someone put it in her bed to wake her up, but there’s no one in her house, not even a gecko.</p> 
		<p>She can’t believe she slept 12 hours.</p>
		<p><em>Maybe I am fucking pregnant.</em></p>
		<p>Suddenly she feels tough and lichenous, tucked away inside herself from whatever might be happening outside.</p>
		<p>**</p>
		<p>On her motorbike drive to work, a rabid dog lunges at her, causing her to swerve sharply. After driving off a safe distance, she stops and looks back at it. It lies in the middle of the road, sunning.</p>
		<p>She gets to the lab before E and spends a quiet morning drinking coffee and looking over the data. The coral bleaching is getting worse and <em>what to do, what to do about that</em>. 50% bleached already and it’s only the beginning of the hot season. At some point in her meager little life, she’d decided that the best thing she could do was have this field station and report the data. Tell the authorities. Alert people in power. Bolster the science, strengthen the argument. Not shut up. Perhaps she should do more.</p> 
		<p>E enters the room with her arms full of bags and various other attachments. Her motorbike helmet falls off her arm and rolls toward L. E's eyes go wide and she feigns anger. “My god, what are you doing here?”</p>
		<p>“What do you mean?” L says.</p> 
		<p>“I thought you’d take the day off.”</p> 
		<p>“Oh I’m fine. Got a good night's sleep."</p> 
		<p>E tuts and shakes her head reprovingly.</p>
		<p>**</p>
		<p>Two hours later they’re diving again. It’s been determined L will be divemaster for two of the more experienced students and E will take the newbies. That way, the experienced students can cover some of the more routine data gathering and L can be free to focus on her pet research project, which tests whether smaller solitary corals are less resistant to bleaching than larger solitary corals.</p>  
		<p>E's group lays out the transects while L and her interns hang back and look at coral. She breathes out and sinks closer in to some branching coral, the home of twenty or so baby, white and yellow butterfly fish, who dart in and out like bees. She wishes she were doing a fish survey so that these lovely, tiny fish could be counted. If only their presence could be felt, could matter in the world. But probably they don’t care either way, probably that doesn’t matter to them.</p> 
		<p>Now it’s time to go and she motions the students to go ahead of her. With the lab's underwater camera they take a picture of the transect measuring tape every 50 cm. Back at the lab they will need to go through every one of these 300 pictures and identify the coral just to the left of the transect. She removes her underwater slate from her BCD pocket and begins counting. Everything is slow, deliberate. It’s arduous counting all the solitary corals—there are so many. The students’ frog kicks are too frequent, they are going too fast—almost out of her sight now. No matter, they are safe and experienced. She finishes her survey and meets them at the end of the third transect at 50 minutes into their dive. Together they reel up the transects, spiders assuming the thread of their web back into their abdomens. She directs one of the students to take the transect bag and hook it to her kit. The three of them look at each other in the eyes and L makes the hand signal for “let’s ascend”—a thumbs up.</p> 
		<p>She doesn’t think about that strange sensation. She’s thinking about the data she gathered and about what conclusions she might begin to draw. Slowly, slowly, she swims up, not even needing to think about moving her feet, just willing herself up. And then, at three meters from the surface, once again, it hits.</p>	
		<p>**</p>
		<p>The pressure is more intense this time, the movements of the water like a thousand little flies distracting her attention. The light hits and she feels the heat of the sunrays on her body. The rays form a cone, which twists around her, and she is an unwilling dancer, moving her limbs oddly, floating six inches above an empty stage.</p> 
		<p>And then she is elsewhere. Her face is naked—no regulator. She feels sand in her nose and on her lips. She sputters, rubs her nose with her index and thumb, sticks out her tongue. Opens her eyes. She’s on the beach. Or a beach, rather. She doesn’t recognize the topography of this beach, with its thick forest, its meters of white sand. All the beaches on her island are short, with sparse, low vegetation and pieces of trash strewn about. This beach is pristine. A breeze tumbles down the white sand, unobstructed by a single other person. She is alone.</p>
